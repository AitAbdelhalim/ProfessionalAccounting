# About The project 

PDF documents often contain tables with text, images and figures. In many cases, the relevant data are usually found in the tables.

It is particularly difficult to extract tables from PDF, but fortunately, there are different tools.

In this project, we will browse a directory containing bank statements and extract the various operations by classifying them in categories to generate an Excel file that will be processed in a PowerBI reporting
